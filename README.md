<h2 align="center">In this step will fix problem in Expo with expo/vector-icons  after export to Web </h2>

In this tutorial, we embark on a step-by-step journey to construct a static website on React-Native using expo-router v2. Our goal is to build a website builder and mobile app constructor all in one, with maximum search optimization. The project itself spans a considerable scope, encompassing a Multilingual Website Constructor, user registration, payment capabilities, and an array of other features.

In the upcoming chapters, we will establish the foundation of this site's structure and introduce a multitude of navigational possibilities. As we progress, we'll lay the groundwork for seamless navigation and explore the potential for dynamic, user-centric experiences.

## üìö About this step

This article addresses the challenge of icon display issues with Expo/vector-icons during static site export in React projects. It explores the problem, outlines the steps to set up SVG icons, and offers a comprehensive guide to ensure icons are seamlessly integrated, empowering users to craft custom icons and enhance their app's style.

## üó∫  Step-by-Step Guide:<br/>

Solving Icon Issues with Expo/vector-icons during Static Site Export in React<br/>

As we rejoiced over the impressive template of a static site that Expo Router v2 had provided, a predicament quickly emerged: after exporting via metro.config in Expo, we faced a challenge with Expo/vector-icons. As you can see in the image below, the icons were either missing or replaced by rectangles. A disheartening setback indeed.<br/>

<img align="center" alt="expo sdk" height="80%" src="./assets/images/git/Scr2.1.png">

In my pursuit of a solution, I scoured the internet and stumbled upon pages like this: [https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/21568](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/21568).<br/><br/>

I spent considerable time experimenting with importing icons using React Native and React, but to no avail. After attempts at building, if successful at all, the outcome remained unchanged: the icons were not displaying in my Expo application.<br/>

But is this a setback? Quite the opposite ‚Äì it's an opportunity.<br/>

As a reminder, we're creating a website and mobile app builder that empowers anyone to craft their own site for Google or other social platforms, free of charge.<br/> 

This implies that our users would undoubtedly be disappointed if the potential of our builder was limited by the scope of expo/vector-icons.<br/>

In other words, I decided not to confine myself to Expo/vector-icon icons. Instead, I aimed to create a foundation that would enable users to generate icons from any SVG file in the future. Large or small icons, colored or monochrome ‚Äì any icons for Expo.<br/>

<img align="center" alt="expo sdk" height="80%" src="./assets/images/git/Scr4.png">

Let's get to the heart of the matter.<br/>

To address this, we will set up our project to work with SVG images:<br/>

1. Store icons in the assets folder.<br/>
2. Install the necessary dependencies:<br/> - `npm i react-native-svg.`<br/>
3. Install the second dependency:<br/> - `npm i react-native-svg-transformer` <br/>and configure them as outlined in this guide: <br/>[https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer#readme](https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer#readme).<br/>

4. Create a file metro.config.js in the root directory with the following content:
<br/<br/>
`// Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro`<br/>
`const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");`<br/>
<br/>
`module.exports = (() =>`{<br/>
`const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname,`{<br/>
    `isCSSEnabled: true,`<br/>
`});`<br/>
<br/>
`const { transformer, resolver } = config;`<br/>
<br/>
`config.transformer =`{<br/>
    `...transformer,`<br/>
    `babelTransformerPath: require.resolve("react-native-svg-transformer"),`<br/>
`}`;<br/>
`config.resolver =`{<br/>
    `...resolver,`<br/>
    `assetExts: resolver.assetExts.filter((ext) => ext !== "svg"),`<br/>
    `sourceExts: [...resolver.sourceExts, "svg"],`<br/>
`};`<br/>
<br/><br/>
` return config;`<br/>
`})();`]<br/>
<br/>

5. Create a declarations.d.ts file in the root directory with the following content:<br/>


- [`declare module "*.svg" `]{<br/>
    - [`import React from "react";`]<br/>
    - [`import { SvgProps } from "react-native-svg";`]<br/>
    - [`const content: React.FC<SvgProps>;`]<br/>
    - [`export default content;<br/>`]
<br/>
<br/>

6. Open [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/) and download the required icons to the "icons" folder that we created for this purpose.<br/>

<img align="center" alt="expo sdk" height="80%" src="./assets/images/git/Scr5.png">

7. Use npm start to launch our project.<br/>

8. Update imports accordingly.<br/>

9. Revise icon usage. Unlike with expo/vector-icons, with SVG we use "fill" instead of "color." Also, specify dimensions using width and height.<br/>

10. Finally, execute npx expo export -p web and examine the outcome.<br/>

We now have icons for Expo that are not limited by style or quantity as in expo/vector-icons. Users can not only select icons from the existing pool but also incorporate custom-made icons that align with the app's style.<br/>

Additionally, I recommend opening the link on your phone and toggling between light and dark themes. Observe how this new template from Expo Router v2 adapts to the device's color scheme.<br/>

Kudos to the developers of this tabs template ‚Äì our start has been truly impressive.<br/>

Have you encountered any icon issues with Expo? I'll give you a hint: the back arrow is missing in the modal window.<br/>

Download this repository to your computer. Run npm init followed by npm start and try adding your own arrow to the modal window panel.<br/>

In the next segment, we'll delve into exploring other navigators. We'll create an app using the Drawer navigator, face an unsolvable navigation challenge, and most likely revert back to the original version of the app.
